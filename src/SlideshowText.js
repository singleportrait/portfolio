          Over 6 months, I worked with Aidin, an NYC-based healthcare company, to redesign and bring product thinking to their app. Aidin helps ease patient care transitions (say, moving from a hospital to a nursing home) by bringing quality data to the moment when patients choose where they want to receive their care.
          <br /><br />
          Together we rebuilt Aidin from the ground up, rethinking how referrals are sent, received, and managed, as well as

          exploring their future-forward business goals. Aidinâ€™s users are hospital case managers and provider intake coordinators that use Aidin all-day, every day, so it was important to do extensive user testing, interviewing, and demoing of our proposed solutions as we progressed.
          <br /><br />
          Iâ€™m continuing to work with them through development, providing project management, design consultation, code review, and QA testing as the project moves into reality.
